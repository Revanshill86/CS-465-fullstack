**Architecture -**
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

**Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database? One of the main advantages of MongoDB is its flexibility and scalability.**

Unlike traditional relational databases, which have a fixed schema and structure, MongoDB is a document-oriented database that allows for flexible and dynamic schema designs. This makes it easier to adapt to changing data requirements and to scale horizontally as the application grows.

Another advantage of MongoDB is its ability to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. This can be particularly useful in applications that deal with complex data structures or large volumes of data, such as social networks, e-commerce sites, or IoT applications.

**Functionality**
**How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?** 
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, but it is not the same as the JavaScript programming language. JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is based on a subset of the JavaScript language. It is used to represent data in a structured and portable way that can be easily transmitted over the internet.

JavaScript, on the other hand, is a programming language that is used for creating dynamic and interactive web pages. JavaScript can be used to manipulate JSON data and to create and modify HTML and CSS elements in the browser.

JSON can tie together the frontend and backend development pieces by providing a common data format that can be used to transfer data between the two layers.
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

**Testing**
**Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.**
In a full stack application, there are two main types of APIs: client-side and server-side. Testing these APIs can be challenging due to the complexity and variety of methods, endpoints, and security measures involved. Various methods for API testing include unit testing, integration testing, functional testing, load testing, and security testing. Security measures can be implemented at various levels, such as the network, server, application, and data layers. A comprehensive approach involving different teams and roles is required to test APIs effectively.

**Reflection**
**How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?**
While I am still working on getting the functionality right, I must say that this course has been incredibly enriching. The course content covered a lot of material, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of full stack architectures and how the back end and front end work together.

One of the most valuable takeaways from the course has been the opportunity to learn about various frameworks. This has not only broadened my knowledge base but also allowed me to explore different options for implementing solutions to problems.

The course has given me a great foundation to build my skills upon. I feel more confident in my ability to design and develop full stack applications, as well as troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

Going forward, I plan to continue using the skills and knowledge that I gained from this course to design websites on my own. By doing this, I will be able to solidify my understanding of full stack development and gain practical experience in applying the concepts I learned.

Overall, I am very grateful for this course and everything I have learned from it. I believe it has equipped me with the skills and knowledge needed to be successful in full stack development, and I look forward to putting them into practice.
